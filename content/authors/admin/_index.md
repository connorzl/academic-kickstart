I am a first-year Computer Science PhD Student at Stanford University, working with [Leonidas Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/) and [Gordon Wetzstein](https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/) during my initial rotations. My research lies in the intersection of computer graphics and machine learning, and I am currently working on discovering and leveraging structure from 3D shapes. 

Previously, I worked at Google as a software engineer on mobile computational photography (mostly related to Portrait Mode on Pixel phones).

I was also a Computer Science undergraduate and graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/). This culminated in my Master's Thesis on quad meshing. 

Outside of work, I enjoy watching movies, playing video/boardgames with friends, and listening to [music](https://www.last.fm/user/connorzl) (long-time swiftie). Also a fan of traveling, sports, and good food :)
